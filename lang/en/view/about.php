Tecno-lixo activities began in 2019, but the project was deactivated during the pandemic. Currently, the project is active.<br>The project was born from a long-standing dream of working with the reuse of old computer parts. The project took shape and today we work on raising awareness about the correct disposal of electronic waste through awareness workshops. Thus, we are able to reuse many computer parts that would otherwise be of no use.',
