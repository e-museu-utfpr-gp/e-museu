Often these objects have no monetary value, but immeasurable historical value. Because of this, museums were created—non-profit places that aim to present, in whole or in part, the history and culture of a people.\n\nOur project aims to learn about the past and understand the present, in both cultural and technological matters, so as to avoid past mistakes. Our computing museum exists to preserve the history of various computing items, and to show people the past of computers, teach and record everything that has been created most notably up to the present.",
